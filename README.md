# xChecker

This is a basic XSS checker that uses a redirect to check if it worked or not. The coding is chicken scratch - you've been warned. It will be improved as time goes on, as it only works with FireFox. As Google decided that "--disable-web-security" wasn't an option anymore.

## Getting started

### Install

You will need selenium, geckodriver and Python 2.7. This has been tested on Win10.
